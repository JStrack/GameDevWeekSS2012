Slick - A 2D LWJGL Java Utility Library (out of date)
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a very early version. The tests work but no demo has been written yet. Yes the windows natives
are included in the main distribution in the right place. This is just meant to make it easier for quick
start windows users. All the natives required can be found in jars in the 'lib' directory.
